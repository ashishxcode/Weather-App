The purpose of the project was to learn JavaScript:

- Object
- Array
- DOM Manipulation
- API Calls

### Tech

Weather-App uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api) - Fetching Weather Data
- [VanialJS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - Awesome text editor
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Hosting Website

And of course Weather-App itself is open source with a [public repository](https://github.com/ashishxcode/Weather-App) on GitHub.
